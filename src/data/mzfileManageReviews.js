        "I love how it downloads the large files while app is in the background and also notifies timely when download finishes. With this app i can easily export downloaded files to my pc wirelessly. The only concerning thing is this app needs direct link to download files, it will be awesome if it detect the download file automatically ðŸ‘Œ",
