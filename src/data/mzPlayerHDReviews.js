        "This is a great app but it does need a few things including the ability to search for and listen to playlists. Keep the good work up. I love how accessible this is with voiceover which is a screen reader made by Apple for the visually impaired. This is the kind of app I have been looking for. If you add the ability to share YouTube links and play playlist, this would be the perfect app for me.",
